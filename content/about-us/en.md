WePray.org is an environment that encourages you to pray more.

Here you can send a prayer request or thank for blessings received.

Build your own prayer list. Mark a request as "favorite" and pray until the petitioner indicates that the blessing was granted.

Help build the kingdom of God in this world through your prayers!

"Ask, and you will receive, that your joy may be full" (John 16:24, NKJV)

We fully support the "United in Prayer" initiative, organized by the ministerial association of the Seventh-day Adventist Church.
